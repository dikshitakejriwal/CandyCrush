# Candy Crush Clone

Welcome to my Candy Crush Clone! This project is a fun, interactive game developed to mimic the classic Candy Crush experience. 

## How to Play

The game is played on a 9x9 board filled with various colored candies. The objective is simple: align three or more candies of the same color vertically or horizontally to crush them and earn points. The game continues with candies falling from the top to fill the empty spaces, allowing for new combinations and chain reactions.

### Game Features:

- **Dynamic Board Generation**: The board initializes with a random set of candies in a 9x9 grid.
- **Drag and Drop Functionality**: Players can drag a candy and drop it onto an adjacent square to swap positions, aiming to match three or more candies of the same color.
- **Score Tracking**: Each successful match increases the player's score, with the total score displayed continuously.
- **Automatic Candy Crush**: The game automatically detects matches of three or more candies and crushes them, allowing new candies to fall from the top.
- **Continuous Gameplay**: The game loop continues with candies being crushed, replaced, and the board being updated, offering endless play.

## Technologies Used
